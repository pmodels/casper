                          Changes in 1.0
======================================================================

- Provide asynchronous progress for RMA communication on window created
  by MPI_Win_allocate.

- Runtime load balancing. This feature is disabled by default, enable it
  by setting --enable-runtime-load at configure time.

- Multi-threading MPI supported. Internal critical sections are needed
  to ensure thread-safety when using Casper with multi-threaded MPI
  program (MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE). This feature is disabled by default
  for better performance, enable it by setting --enable-thread-safety
  at configure time.

- IZEM thread library supported. IZEM provides light weight user-space
  level thread lock. Use it for Casper internal critical sections instead
  of traditional POSIX thread locks by setting --with-thread-package=izem
  and --with-izem=[DIR] at configure time.
