/* CASPER_VERSION is the version string. CASPER_NUMVERSION is the
 * numeric version that can be used in numeric comparisons.
 *
 * CASPER_VERSION uses the following format:
 * Version: [MAJ].[MIN].[REV][EXT][EXT_NUMBER]
 * Example: 1.0.7rc1 has
 *          MAJ = 1
 *          MIN = 0
 *          REV = 7
 *          EXT = rc
 *          EXT_NUMBER = 1
 *
 * CASPER_NUMVERSION will convert EXT to a format number:
 *          ALPHA (a) = 0
 *          BETA (b)  = 1
 *          RC (rc)   = 2
 *          PATCH (p) = 3
 * Regular releases are treated as patch 0
 *
 * Numeric version will have 1 digit for MAJ, 2 digits for MIN, 2
 * digits for REV, 1 digit for EXT and 2 digits for EXT_NUMBER. So,
 * 1.0.7rc1 will have the numeric version 10007201.
